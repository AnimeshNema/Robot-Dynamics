# Robot-Dynamics
The ABB_IRB120 file invloves solving the forward kinematics of the ABB robot arm. The results were also cross-checked with Robot Studio.
The Neobotix-Schunck file contains forward and inverse kinematics of the Schunck robot arm with and without the moving base.
The Lagrangian-Euler file contains the solutions using two different methods. 1)Lagrangian approach and 2) Newton-Euler method

All the folders contain respective MATLAB files and a pdf for the final outcome.
